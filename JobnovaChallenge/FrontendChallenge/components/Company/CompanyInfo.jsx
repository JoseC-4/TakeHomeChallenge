    about:"Kforce has a client that is seeking a UI/UX Developer in Madison, WI. Overview: In brief, we are a handful of AI-powered tools for our workflow which could use a facelift to improve the overall user experience. In an ideal scenario, we would love to bring on someone that has the skills to work directly in our codebases (engineering skills) while they make improvements to the UI/UX based on their knowledge of best practices. We currently have three tools that users are interacting with; one is an Edge browser extension (JavaScript), one is using a Streamlit web application (Python) currently but we'd be open to migrating this to React/Angular/other framework, and the other is a basic React web application.",
